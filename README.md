# rl-predator-prey
Reinforcement Learning in a Predator Prey model.
Basically an implementation with modifications of the paper:

“An Agent-Based Predator-Prey Model with Reinforcement Learning” by  M. Olsen and R. Fraczkowski.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/doesburg11/rl-predator-prey
cd rl-predator-prey
```

```bash
python main.py --gridDim 70 --nGrass 1400
```
