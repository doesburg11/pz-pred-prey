# PettingZoo predator prey AEC 
Reinforcement Learning in a Predator Prey model.
Basically an implementation with modifications of the paper:

“An Agent-Based Predator-Prey Model with Reinforcement Learning” by  M. Olsen and R. Fraczkowski.

### PettingZoo
This implementation does use the PettinZoo library for strictly AEC turned
actiom behavior of the various agents (predators, Prey, Grass).

Behavior predators: 
- moving to Mooreneigh borhood (choice)
- eating prey (automaticy)
- metabolisme energy by aging (automaticly)
- metabolism energy bij moving (choice)
- reproduce (automticly above treshold energy level)
